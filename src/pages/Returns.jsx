              At YADARDA GEETA TRADERS, we are committed to providing you with high-quality industrial supplies and rock tools. We understand that there may be occasions where you need to return a product, and we aim to make this process as straightforward as possible. Please read the following information carefully to understand our returns policy.
            </p>

            <h2>1. Eligibility for Returns</h2>
            <p>
              We accept returns on most products within 7 days of the date of purchase/delivery.<br/>
              To be eligible for a return, your item must be unused, in the same condition that you received it, and in the original packaging.<br/>
              Some products may be exempt from returns due to hygiene reasons or manufacturer restrictions. Please refer to the specific product page for details.
            </p>

            <h2>2. Initiation of Return</h2>
            <p>
              To initiate a return, please contact our customer service team at "yadardageeta@yandex.com" within the specified return period.<br/>
              Provide your order number and details of the item(s) you wish to return.<br/>
              Our customer service team will guide you through the returns process and provide you with a return authorization (RA) number if necessary.
            </p>

            <h2>3. Return Shipping</h2>
            <p>
              Customers are responsible for the cost of return shipping unless the return is due to our error or a defective product.<br/>
              We recommend using a trackable shipping service and purchasing shipping insurance to ensure your return is received safely.
            </p>

            <h2>4. Refunds</h2>
            <p>
              Once your return is received and inspected, we will send you an email to notify you that we have received your returned item. We will also notify you of the approval or rejection of your refund.<br/>
              If your return is approved, your refund will be processed, and a credit will automatically be applied to your original method of payment within a certain number of days, depending on your payment provider's policies.
            </p>

            <h2>5. Exchanges</h2>
            <p>
              If you need to exchange an item for a different size or color, please contact our customer service team to arrange for an exchange.<br/>
              Exchanges are subject to product availability. If the requested item is not available, we will issue a refund or store credit as appropriate.
            </p>

            <h2>6. Restocking Fee</h2>
            <p>
              A restocking fee may apply to certain returns, particularly for large or specialized items. This fee will be deducted from your refund amount.
            </p>

            <h2>7. Damaged or Defective Items</h2>
            <p>
              If you receive a damaged or defective item, please contact us immediately to arrange for a replacement or refund.<br/>
              We may require photographic evidence of the damage or defect to process your claim efficiently.
            </p>

            <h2>8. Final Sale Items</h2>
            <p>
              Certain items may be marked as final sale and are not eligible for returns, exchanges, or refunds. Please check the product description carefully before making your purchase.
